# NextLevelWeek01
Week development of a full-stack project performed by the CTO of Rocketseat Diego Fernandes

Here I've exercised several skills building an SPA, mobile app and a back-end service of a small project called <strong>Ecoleta</strong>.

Features suchs as map integration, db, CRUD file upload and was explored in one week using ReactJS, React Native and NodeJS frameworks with typescript.
